We implemented a complementary filter that combined position data from both the accelerometer and the gyroscope. The complementary filter
takes the low pass data from the accelerometer to accommodate for noise and the high pass data from the gyro to account for drift. In addition 
to the implemented complementary filter that was utilized in software, we made use of the on board low pass filter for the accelerometer. This greatly
helped with reducing noise off that sensor and giving cleaner position updates. The low pass filter of the imu sets the cutoff frequency based off the
sampling rate. The sampling rate or ODR (no decimation) is set to 952 and the cutoff frequency is set to 952/50 ~= 20 Hz. This is controlled by setting the
registers in the IMU library.
